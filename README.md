# Moona
Moona is my very personal multi-purpose framework, containing all sorts of tools to do all sorts of things. From setting up graphic interfaces up to useful methods and objects to code your own stuff, you might find something interesting.

## What is this?

My intent with Moona is to develop a very handy framework that can help software developers with a wide variety of tools and features. There is something I particularly wish, too, which is to achieve solid bases to use Moona for game developement and to create graphical interfaces.

For now, though, Moona is very simple: it's nothing more than a simple .jar file containing some useful object. With each major improvement I will try to add some new cool feature to expand this framework as much as I can.

*NOTE: Moona will probably be ported to some other language, too. A C++ version (directly utilizing OpenGL) will be soon under developement*

## Versions

I will develop Moona using the following order of releases:

> **early_dev :** The first phase of development, where most of the features will be builded and where the framework will take its initial shape.

> **alpha :** Once Moona will reach a satisfying ammount of features I will proceed with the alpha phase, where I will focus on both adding new features and making the ones added in early_dev more perfect.

> **beta :** The closest version to the full release, where the main focus will be to get as close as possible to a fully functional release.

> **release :** The actual full version which is (should hopefylly be) fully stable and safe to use.

> **snapshots :** Between each major release, snapshots will be released to introduce new features (they'll have the same purpose of alphas and betas, but they're actually based on stable code, with the only exception of the newly implemented features).

Of the many releases, every one of them will be tagged with one of these tags to communicate the current developing status.

## Contributing to the project

I do not plan on making this an open-source project, but I would also like to keep an active community-dev interaction.

If this framework will get famous enough for people to start wanting some particular feature implemented, just ask for it to be added via pull-requests or issues (in case a feature of yours could help to solve a reported error).
