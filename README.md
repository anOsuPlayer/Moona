My very personal multi-purpose framework, containing all sorts of tools to do all sorts of things. From setting up graphic interfaces up to useful methods and objects to code your own stuff, you might find something interesting.

For now it's only in its early developement: when more things will be added, I will update this file.

I plan on developing many features for this framework including, hopefully, a version for some other language other than java, too. You can request features, if you want, and I'll try my best to add them.

If I get the chance, I will make my own website to have some useful documentation to get started with this framework, too. For now, I will document every major change or big feature in each greater release.

For now, to get started, you can either refer to the 'GUIDE.md' file or to the sources attached to each release.
